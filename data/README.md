Data For OSU Hackathon

There are two types of files, data and config, linked on the column MeterID.

## Data Files

The data files contain time series data for the challenge. Each meter represents the consumption for one of the following resources: Chilled Water, Heating Hot Water, Steam, or Electricity. Each meter has two years (or less in some cases) of usage. There are three files. One contains daily data for all meters. Two others are hourly data split into two files due to size limitations.

Field Name | Field Description
---------- | -----------------
MeterID |              Meter identifier, will have a match in the config file
CurrentValue |         Most precise measurement value
ValueString |          Less precise measurement value
Time |                 Time of measurement in UTC, format yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ
Status |               Sometimes meters malfunction, this indicates if this measurement is OK or UNRELIABLE
StatusCode |           Numeric representation of status
                      

## Config Files

The config file contains metadata for the challenge. Each meter represents consumption for a building. Meter and building attributes are included here, if available.
